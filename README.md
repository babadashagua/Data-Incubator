# Data-Incubator Proposal

Goal: in this proposal, I want to find companies where hiring is most predictive of stock prices. This can be useful and instructional for a company to estimate stock market reactions to the its hiring situation. 

Dataset: currently I am using Linkedin Profile Dataset including data of company name, employee number, date, etc., and Huge Stock Market Dataset which contains data of ticker symbol, data, stock minimum and highest price of the day, etc. 

Findings: use correlation coefficient between employee number monthly change and stock price monthly change as an indicator for stock market reaction to the company hiring situation. The higher of the correlation, the larger impact of the company hiring on the stock price.
