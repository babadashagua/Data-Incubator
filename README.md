# Data-Incubator Proposal

Goal: I plan to find companies whose hiring situations are good predictors of their stock prices. This can be useful for a company to estimate the reaction of the stock market to its hiring situation. To be more specific, I plan to identify factors related to hiring and quantify their impacts on a company's stock price. I expect different industrial areas to have different patterns of impact (factor, temporal delay, magnitude, direction, etc.) depending on their business models. The proposed research will help us to better find the areas where hiring-based predictions perform well.

Dataset: currently I am using Linkedin Profile Dataset including data of company name, employee number, date, etc., and Huge Stock Market Dataset which contains data of ticker symbol, data, stock minimum and highest price of the day, etc. 

Findings: use correlation coefficient between employee number monthly change and stock price monthly change as an indicator for stock market reaction to the company hiring situation. I analyzed data of automotive companies. The result shows that correlation coefficient can help us to find companies whose stock prices are highly related with their hiring situation.
